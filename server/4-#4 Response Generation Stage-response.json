The workflow I used to answer your request includes three tasks: image-to-text, object-detection, and visual-question-answering. For the image-to-text task, I used the model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning, which is best suited for this task as it has the highest number of likes and is specifically designed for this task. It also has a local inference endpoint which makes it faster and more stable. For the object-detection task, I used the model facebook/detr-resnet-50, which is best suited for this task as it has a ResNet-50 backbone and is specifically designed for this purpose. It also has the most likes and the most detailed description, making it the best choice. For the visual-question-answering task, I used the model dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa, which is the only model available. The inference result for this task is that there are two zebras in the picture. The complete path or urls of files in inference results are /images/8092.jpg and public//examples/c.jpg.
